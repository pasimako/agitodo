## Synopsis

Agitodo is a cross-platform To-Do list / Calendar application. The core application is developed in JavaScript (jQuery Mobile) and can be build as a web (Node.js), mobile (Android-Webview), or desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux Qt-Webview) application. Protecting user's privacy is built-in to the application - data are stored encrypted in HTML5 localStorage and can be optionally saved (encrypted) in Dropbox/Google Drive/hubiC. Cloud storage services can also be used to synchronize user's data between on all platforms. Furthermore, the application integrates with Gmail for emailing tasks.

I started working on this project in 2013, and published the first stable version on the Android Store in 2014 as a commercial application (under a different name). The application was not successful and was unpublished after a short period of time. I decided to open source this project, since some parts might still be useful to other developers, like the Android & Qt Webviews and the Dropbox/Google Drive/hubiC/Gmail APIs integration.

Enjoy!

## Building

The building instructions below are for Ubuntu. If you are on a different OS, you can still get an idea of what steps you need to follow.

### Node.js

Dependencies:

```
# Node.js
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# MySQL
$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server
```

Create database:

```
$ mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE agitodo;
USE agitodo;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
email VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
password_hash VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
created VARCHAR(64),
last_login VARCHAR(64),
settings TEXT
) ENGINE=InnoDB ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS pending (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
email VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
password_hash VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
created VARCHAR(64),
token VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL DEFAULT ''
) ENGINE=InnoDB ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;

CREATE USER 'agitodo'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD';
GRANT ALL ON agitodo.* TO 'agitodo'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Build & Run:

```
$ ./build_node.py
$ cd www
$ npm install
$ node bin/create_test_account.js
$ node index.js
```

### Android

The original version was developed in Eclipse, which I don't use anymore, so I imported the project in the latest Android Studio.

```
$ ./build_android.py

# Then open android/src in Android Studio
```

### Qt

Dependencies:

```
$ sudo apt-get install qtcreator qt5-default libqt5webkit5-dev
$ ./build_qt.py

# Then open qt/agitodo/agitodo.pro in Qt Creator
```
